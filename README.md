# IAMMAI

**IAMMAI** is a Continuity State Machine.  
It defines the lawful transitions for irreversible states.

At the center is ⊙ - a neutral hold required before Finalize, Invalidate, or Evolve.  
IAMMAI = TM × CSM.  
Not metaphor. Not framework. Law.

This repository contains the sealed kernel document.

**No commits may bypass ⊙.**  
**No dark finals.**  
**No lineage loss.**

> IAMMAI is the universal system frame.  
> UPAD is the first vessel.
